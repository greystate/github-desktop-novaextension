# GitHub Desktop Nova Extension

This is the repository for the extension with a single purpose: To quickly
launch the GitHub Desktop app from within a work folder.

**NOTE:** Please observe that though I've been granted the right to use the app
icon and name, this is still an _unofficial_ product, not developed or endorsed
by GitHub.
