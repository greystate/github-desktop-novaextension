The **GitHub Desktop Unofficial Launcher** Nova extension enables launching the **GitHub Desktop** app
with the current workspace's repository loaded. If the workspace doesn't have a
Git repo yet, the app will ask you what to do, as usual.

## Requirements

This extension requires that the [GitHub Desktop][APP] app is installed and that the
command line tool has been installed too (available from the app's _GitHub Desktop > Install Command Line Tool…_ menu)

[APP]: https://desktop.github.com

## Usage

To launch GitHub Desktop from within Nova:

- Select the **Extensions → Launch GitHub Desktop** menu item; or
- Open the command palette and type `Launch GitHub Desktop`
